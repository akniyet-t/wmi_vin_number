# wmi_vin_number
**Description**:
A data analysis project for filling missing values in a dataset using machine learning. The dataset, named VinRequest, contains information about vehicle requests, including user IDs, request times, VIN requests, brands, model names, model dates, and JSON responses.

**Objective**:
The main objective of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to impute missing values in the 'Brand' and 'ModelName' columns of the VinRequest dataset.

**Key Features:**
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict missing values in 'Brand' and 'ModelName'.
Connects to Microsoft SQL Server to retrieve dataset.
Handles data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis using Python and popular data science libraries.
Provides an option to train and save a machine learning model for future predictions.
Demonstrates the use of Google Colab for collaborative coding and execution of machine learning tasks.
